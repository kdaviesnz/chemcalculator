        "What about the chlorination of larger molecules that have different kinds of hydrogens? In methane only one kind of hydrogen is available to be pulled off — and so only one possible product can be made — but in larger molecules, several products can be formed. For example, butane (see Figure 8-24) has two types of hydrogen. Hydrogens are classified according to the substitution of the carbon to which they’re attached. Hydrogens attached to primary carbons (or carbons bonded to only one other carbon) are called primary hydrogens, hydrogens attached to secondary carbons (or carbons bonded to two other carbons) are called secondary hydrogens, and so on."

They’re easily made and converted into other things; this makes them                       particularly useful as go-betweens in the synthesis of complex molecules. In this book, I show how                      alkenes are converted into alkanes, cycloalkanes, cyclic ethers, alcohols, alkyl halides, aldehydes, and                carboxylic acids. Talk about versatile.

"Alkenes are compounds that contain carbon-carbon double bonds. Because alkenes are so often found in valuable compounds (like pharmaceuticals), they’re one of the most important functional groups in organic chemistry. Alkenes are also very versatile, because they’re easy to make and convert into other molecules, as Figure 9-1 shows. Therefore, alkenes become useful as waypoints on the road to synthesizing other molecules"

    The two different limonene molecules shown in Figure 6-1 are stereoisomers (molecules with the same atom connectivity but with different orientations of those atoms in space). Stereoisomers are different from constitutional isomers. Constitutional isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but with atoms connected to each other in different ways (see Chapter 7).

        Your hands, for example, are stereoisomers. On both hands, all your fingers are attached in the same way — thumb, index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and pinky, in that exact order. But although your hands have the same finger connectivity, your hands are not identical — they’re stereoisomers of each other."

    Molecules that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other are called enantiomers. Your right hand is the enantiomer of your left hand because your hands are mirror images of each other (put your right hand up to a mirror, and you’ll see what looks like a left hand). Enantiomers cannot be superimposed onto each other, just as your right hand cannot be superimposed on your left hand"

    Molecules that are not superimposable on their mirror images (like the halogenated methane shown in Figure 6-3) are said to be chiral molecules (hard k sound, rhymes with viral). Conversely, molecules that can be superimposed on their mirror images are said to be achiral.

            Only chiral molecules have enantiomers

    How can you tell whether a molecule will be chiral or achiral without constructing the molecule’s mirror image and seeing if the two can be superimposed? Most often, chiral molecules contain at least one carbon atom with four nonidentical substituents. Such a carbon atom is called a chiral center (or sometimes a stereogenic center), using organic-speak. Any molecule that contains a chiral center will be chiral (with one exception, discussed later).

    Any molecule that contains a chiral center will be chiral, with one exception: Those molecules that contain a plane of symmetry will be achiral. A plane of symmetry is a plane that cuts a molecule in half, yielding two halves that are mirror reflections of each other.
