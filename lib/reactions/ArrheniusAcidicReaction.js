Strong Arrhenius acids are those that completely dissociate in water to make hydronium ions, while acids that only partially dissociate in water are said to be weak Arrhenius acids"

It is the positive ion present when an Arrhenius acid is dissolved in water, as Arrhenius acid molecules in solution give up a proton (a positive hydrogen ion, H+) to the surrounding water molecules (H2O).
            // Example
            // HNO3     +    H2O ->     NO3-   +  H3O+

            // Reaction = used to show the change of molecules by a reaction
            // Note that because the nitric acid loses a proton (H+) it ends up having more electrons than protons and hence becomes a negatively charged anion.
            // CH3COOH.   +   H2O <->. CH3OO-  +  H30*
