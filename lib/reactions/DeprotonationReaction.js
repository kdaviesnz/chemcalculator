//DeprotonationReaction
/*
@see note 20

Deprotonation is the removal of a proton from a Brønsted–Lowry acid in an acid-base reaction. The species formed is the conjugate base of that acid. The complementary process, when a proton is added to a Brønsted–Lowry base, is protonation. The species formed is the conjugate acid of that base.

A Brønsted-Lowry acid is a molecule that donates a proton (H+) to a base; a Brønsted-Lowry base is a molecule that accepts a proton from an acid.

"An H+ ion is called a proton because the hydrogen atom has no neutrons or electrons — just a single proton at the nucleus.

To keep the terminology straight, the deprotonated acid becomes what is known as the conjugate base (usually negatively charged, but not always), while the protonated base becomes the conjugate acid.
